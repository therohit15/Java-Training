// \\Usecase
// Once upon a time, there was a restaurant üç¥ where a chef could cook the same dish in different ways.
// If a customer ordered 2 ingredients (like rice and curry), the chef prepared a simple meal.
// If someone gave 3 ingredients (rice, curry, and chicken), the chef made a special meal üçó.
// And if a customer gave two special items like juices (double values), the chef blended them into a drink ü•§.
// Although the dish name was always "CookFood", the way it was prepared changed with ingredients.
// This is exactly how method overloading works ‚Äî same method name but different parameter lists.
// In Java, the method name cookFood() can be written many times but with different arguments.
// The compiler decides at compile-time which version of the method to call.
// So the chef (like the compiler) knows which dish to prepare depending on the input type and number.
// Thus, Method Overloading makes the program (or restaurant üçΩ) more flexible and user-friendly.

// Input Format
// First line: Enter two integers (like 5 10 ‚Üí rice + curry).
// Second line: Enter three integers (like 2 4 6 ‚Üí rice + curry + chicken).
// Third line: Enter two doubles (like 3.5 2.5 ‚Üí juice blending).

// Output Format
// Print sum of two integers (represents simple meal).
// Print sum of three integers (represents special meal).
// Print sum of two doubles (represents juice).

// Test Cases 
// Input-1:
// 5 10
// 2 4 6
// 3.5 2.5

// Output-1:
// Simple Meal (2 items): 15
// Special Meal (3 items): 12
// Juice Mix (2 drinks): 6.0

// Input-2:
// 8 12
// 10 20 30
// 4.5 5.5


// Output-2:
// Simple Meal (2 items): 20
// Special Meal (3 items): 60
// Juice Mix (2 drinks): 10.0
