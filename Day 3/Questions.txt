Q1
Temperature Check for Outdoor Activities
You are organizing an outdoor event and need to decide whether it's safe 
for participants to go outside based on the current temperature. Temperatures 
below zero degrees Celsius are considered too cold and unsafe, while temperatures 
above zero are suitable for outdoor activities. Write a program to check if the 
given temperature is positive or negative.
Input Format
A single integer input representing the current temperature in degrees Celsius.
Output Format
If the given temperature is positive, print "Safe for outdoor activities."
If the temperature is negative or zero, print "Too cold for outdoor activities."
Constraints
The temperature can be any integer (positive, negative, or zero).
Example 1
Sample Input 1
15
Sample Output 1
Safe for outdoor activities
Explanation
The given temperature is 15 degrees Celsius, which is above zero. Hence, the output 
is "Safe for outdoor activities."
Example 2
Sample Input 2
-5
Sample Output 2
Too cold for outdoor activities
Explanation
The given temperature is -5 degrees Celsius, which is below zero. Hence, the output 
is "Too cold for outdoor activities."
Example 3
Sample Input 2
0
Sample Output 3
Too cold for outdoor activities
Explanation
The temperature is zero degrees Celsius, which is not suitable for outdoor activities.
Hence, the output is "Too cold for outdoor activities."



Q2
Rock, Paper, Scissors
Two players A and B, are playing the game of Rock, Paper, Scissors. Player A chooses a
move represented by a string value M: and the move can be one of the following: ‘rock’, 
‘paper’, or 'scissors' where,
rock beats scissors
scissors beats paper
paper beats rock
Your task is to find and return a string value representing the winning move for Player B.
Note
The output is case sensitive
Input Format
Input1: A string value M representing the move chosen by Player A
Output Fomat
Return a string representing the winning move for Player B.
Sample Input
Input1:rock
Sample Output
Paper
Explanation
Here, Player A chooses rock. The winning move for Player B is 'paper, as 'paper' 
beats 'rock' in the game of Rock, Paper, Scissors Hence, paper is returned as the output.



Q3.
Joey's Quest for the Trendy Meatball Sandwich
Joey Tribbiani, a huge fan of sandwiches, spots an irresistible offer at his favorite sandwich shop. 
The shop promises free sandwiches for life to anyone who can identify whether a given number is a "Trendy Number." 
Joey, excited at the prospect, wants to check various numbers to see if they qualify. A "Trendy Number" is defined 
as a 3-digit number where the middle digit is divisible by 3. Can you help Joey write a program that determines 
whether a given number is a "Trendy Number"?
Write a program that takes an integer n as input and checks the following:
If the number is not a 3-digit number, it should print "Invalid Number".
If the number is a 3-digit number and its middle digit is divisible by 3, it should print "Trendy Number".
If the number is a 3-digit number but its middle digit is not divisible by 3, it should print "Not a Trendy Number".
Input Format
A single integer, n, representing the given number.
Output Format
Print "Trendy Number" if the input satisfies the trendy number conditions.
Print "Not a Trendy Number" if it’s a 3-digit number but doesn’t satisfy the middle-digit divisibility rule.
Print "Invalid Number" if the input number is not a 3-digit number.
Example 1
Sample Input 1
791
Sample Output 1
Trendy Number
Explanation
The input number 791 is a 3-digit number, and its middle digit 9 is divisible by 3, making it a "Trendy Number."
Example 2
Sample Input 2
275
Sample Output 2
Not a Trendy Number
Explanation
The input number 275 is a 3-digit number, but its middle digit 7 is not divisible by 3, so it’s "Not a Trendy Number".
Example 3
Sample Input 3
45
Sample Output 3
Invalid Number
Explanation
The input number 45 is not a 3-digit number, so the output is "Invalid Number".
