Q5)
Drona normally trains his disciples using a board which consists of concentric circles. 
When the student correctly hits the center of the concentric circles, his score is 100. 
The score gets reduced depending on where the students hit on the board. When the student 
hits outside the board, his score is 0. Drona will not allow a student to have his food 
unless he scores 100. Arjuna will always hit the target in his first attempt and he will 
leave early. Others may take more turns to reach a score of 100. Can you write a program 
to determine the number of turns a disciple takes to reach the target score of 'n'?
Input Format:
Input consists of a list of positive integers. The first integer corresponds to the target 
score 'n'. Assume that all the other integers input are less than or equal to n.
Output Format:
Output consists of a single line. Refer sample output for format details.
Sample Input:
100

40
60
Sample Output 1:

Q6)
Virus Growth Prediction
In a country, a new virus has been discovered, and its growth pattern is of utmost importance to health experts 
and government agencies. The virus initially starts with a value of 0.5, and each day, it multiplies by 3. 
Researchers have been tasked with predicting the virus's growth over a certain number of days to understand 
its spread and take necessary preventive measures. The growth follows a predictable mathematical series where 
the virus’s value triples each day.
Your task is to help health professionals generate the virus growth prediction for a given number of days.
Given an integer n, your task is to generate the first n terms of the series that describes the virus's growth. 
The first term starts at 0.5, and each subsequent term is three times the previous term.
Write a program that will take n as input and print the first n terms of the series in the format specified below.
Input Format
The input consists of a single integer n which denotes the number of terms to be printed in the series.
Constraints
n will be a positive integer.
Output Format
The output should be the series of the first n terms, printed as space-separated floating-point numbers, formatted to one decimal place.
Example 1
Sample Input 1
5
Sample Output 1
0.5 1.5 4.5 13.5 40.5
Explanation
For the first sample input n = 5, the series is generated by multiplying each term by 3 starting from 0.5.
0.5 × 3 = 1.5
1.5 × 3 = 4.5
4.5 × 3 = 13.5
13.5 × 3 = 40.5
Therefore, the output is 0.5 1.5 4.5 13.5 40.5.
Example 2
Sample Input 2
1
Sample Output 2
0.5
Explanation
For the second sample input n = 1, the series only contains the first term, which is 0.5.





Q7)
Cricket Run Rate Tracker
During a high-stakes cricket match, the team's management is closely monitoring the run rate, which is a key factor in determining 
the team's performance. Initially, the run rate starts at 95.0 runs per over. For each subsequent over, the run rate increases by 
a fixed amount. The team manager needs to track how the run rate progresses over several overs based on the rate of increase.
Your task is to help the team management by generating and printing the run rate series for a given number of overs. The initial 
run rate is 95.0, and for each over, the run rate increases by a fixed value of 20.5.
Write a program that generates the run rate series starting from 95.0 and increases by 20.5 for each subsequent over. 
The program should generate the series for n overs, where n is the number of terms (overs) in the series.
Input Format
The input consists of a single integer n which denotes the number of overs to be considered (number of terms in the series).
Constraints
n will be a positive integer.
Output Format
The output should be the series of run rates for the first n overs, printed as space-separated floating-point numbers with one decimal place.
Example 1
Sample Input 1
5
Sample Output 1
95.0 115.5 136.0 156.5 177.0
Explanation
Over 1: 95.0
Over 2: 95.0 + 20.5 = 115.5
Over 3: 115.5 + 20.5 = 136.0
Over 4: 136.0 + 20.5 = 156.5
Over 5: 156.5 + 20.5 = 177.0
Output: [95.0, 115.5, 136.0, 156.5, 177.0]
Example 2
Sample Input 2
3
Sample Output 2
95.0 115.5 136.0
Explanation
Over 1: 95.0
Over 2: 95.0 + 20.5 = 115.5
Over 3: 115.5 + 20.5 = 136.0
Output: [95.0, 115.5, 136.0]





Q8)
Virus Growth Rate Prediction Based on Daily Increases
In a research lab, a group of scientists is studying the growth rate of a new virus that is spreading across the population. 
The scientists are tracking the virus's growth over several days, and the virus's growth rate changes every day in a predictable pattern. 
The growth rate on the first day increases by 13, on the second day it increases by twice 13, on the third day it increases 
by three times 13, and so on. They need to predict the virus growth for the next 'n' days.
Your task is to write a program to predict the growth rate for the virus over the first 'n' days, where each day's growth follows the 
pattern described above.
You are given a number 'n' which represents the number of days (or terms in the series). You need to generate the growth rate for the virus 
for the first 'n' days. The growth rate starts with a value of 2 on the first day, and the increase on each subsequent day is based on the 
multiples of 13 as described.
Input Format
The input consists of a single integer 'n', which denotes the number of terms (or days) to be printed in the series.
Constraints
'n' is a positive integer (NA for any additional constraints).
Output Format
Print the series of virus growth rates for 'n' days, separated by spaces.
Example 1
Sample Input 1
5
Sample Output 1
2 15 41 80 132
Explanation
For n = 5, the series starts at 2 and increases in the following pattern:
1st term: 2 (Start)
2nd term: 2 + 13 = 15
3rd term: 15 + (2 * 13) = 41
4th term: 41 + (3 * 13) = 80
5th term: 80 + (4 * 13) = 132
Thus, the output is 2 ,15 ,41, 80 ,132.
Example 2
Sample Input 2
6
Sample Output 2
2 15 41 80 132 197
Explanation
For n = 6, the calculation continues:
6th term: 132 + (5 * 13) = 197
Thus, the output is 2 ,15 ,41, 80 ,132 ,197.
