Q2)
Coding Marathon
N number of people participated in a coding marathon where they were asked to solve some problems. Each problem carried 
1 mark and at the end of the marathon, the total marks that each person achieved was calculated.
As an organizer, you have the list of the total marks that each person achieved. You have to calculate the sum of the 
marks of top K scorers from the list.
Input Format
Input 1:An integer N representing the number of participants.
Input 2:An integer K representing the number of top scorers to consider.
Input 3:A space-separated list of N integers representing the marks of each participant.
Output Format
A single integer representing the sum of the marks of the top K scorers.
Example 1
Sample Input 1
Input1: 4
Input2: 2
Input3: 4 1 2 5
Sample Output 1
9
Explanation
Top 2 scores are 5 and 4. Sum = 5+4 = 9.
Example 2
Sample Input 2
Input1: 4
Input2: 3
Input3: 4 3 6 1
Sample Output 2
13
Explanation
Top 3 scores are 6, 4 and 3. Sum = 6+4+3 = 13.



Q3)
Next Leap Year
You are an app developer, and your company wants you to develop a new feature to engage more users by showing the 
next nearest leap year for a given year, represented by an integer value N. Your task is to find and return an integer
 value representing the next nearest leap year for the given year. If the given year itself is a leap year, then return that.
Input Fomat
Input1: An integer value N representing the given year.
Output Fomat
Return an integer value representing the next nearest leap year for a given year.
Example 1
Sample Input 1
Input1:2021
Sample Output 1
2024
Explanation
Here, the given year is 2021 and the next upcoming leap year would be 2024. Therefore, 2024 is returned as the output.
Example 2
Sample Input 2
Input1:2008
Sample Output 2
2008
Explanation
Here, the given year is 2008, which is itself a leap year. Therefore 2008 is returned as the output.




Q4)
print multiplication of n till 10 and multiplication of n from 2-10(even numbers)





Q5)
Drona normally trains his disciples using a board which consists of concentric circles. 
When the student correctly hits the center of the concentric circles, his score is 100. 
The score gets reduced depending on where the students hit on the board. When the student 
hits outside the board, his score is 0. Drona will not allow a student to have his food 
unless he scores 100. Arjuna will always hit the target in his first attempt and he will 
leave early. Others may take more turns to reach a score of 100. Can you write a program 
to determine the number of turns a disciple takes to reach the target score of 'n'?
Input Format:
Input consists of a list of positive integers. The first integer corresponds to the target 
score 'n'. Assume that all the other integers input are less than or equal to n.
Output Format:
Output consists of a single line. Refer sample output for format details.
Sample Input:
100
4
40
60
Sample Output 1:
The number of turns is 3
Input (stdin)
100
4
40
60
Output (stdout)
The number of turns is 3
