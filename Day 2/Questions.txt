Q1. Write a program to get a character as input and print its Unicode
value. When a character is entered, the character itself is not 
stored. Instead, a numeric value(Unicode value) is stored.

103
Input (stdin)
G
OutputÂ (stdout)
71

7. Q7.
The college ground is rectangular in shape. Management decides to build a fence around the ground.

In order to help the construction workers to build a straight fence, they planned to place a thick rope around the ground.

They wanted to buy only the exact length of the rope that is needed.

They also wanted to cover the entire ground with a thick carpet during the rainy season.

They wanted to buy only the exact quantity of carpet that is needed. They requested your help.

 Can you please help them by writing a program to find the exact length of the rope and the exact quantity

of carper that is required?

8. Q8
During the Physical Education hour, PT sir has decided to conduct some team games.

He wants to split the students in the class into equal-sized teams.

In some cases, there may be some students who are left out from teams and he wanted to use the left out,

 students, to assist him in conducting the team games. For instance, if there are 50 students in the class and

if the class has to be divided into 7 equal-sized teams, 7 students will be there in each team and 1 student will be left out.

 PT sir asks your help to automate this team splitting task. Can you please help him out?
