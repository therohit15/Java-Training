Q2)
A construction company is tasked with designing a safety fence around a playground in such a way that the height of each fence section follows a unique pattern 
for strength and aesthetic purposes. The engineers decide to use Pascal's Triangle to determine the height of each section of the fence.
The requirement is to build a triangle-shaped structure of heights, where each height corresponds to a value in Pascal’s Triangle. The number of rows in the 
triangle must be determined by the user.
Write a program that takes the number of rows as input and outputs Pascal's Triangle, representing the heights of each fence section.
Input Format
An integer n representing the number of rows in Pascal’s Triangle.
Constraints
NA
Output Format
A triangle-shaped pattern of integers, where each number represents the height of a fence section. Ensure there are no trailing spaces at the end of each line.

Q3)
A high-security safe lock manufacturer is designing a unique keypad pattern that can act as a multi-layered security code for vaults. 
The keypad will display a symmetrical number pattern for a given size. The pattern starts from the outer layer with the highest number 
and decreases toward the center, forming a layered effect that represents security levels. The security engineers want a program to 
generate this pattern based on the size of the keypad.
Write a program that takes the size n as input and generates this number pattern for the safe lock design.
Input Format
An integer n representing the size of the security keypad pattern. Note: n must be an odd integer greater than or equal to 3.
Constraints
NA
Output Format
A square-shaped number pattern of size n x n, where numbers decrease from the outer layer to the inner layer, forming a symmetric pattern.

Q4)

In an emergency situation, it is crucial to display safety instructions in a clear and attention-grabbing 
way. A security system at a busy train station is designed to flash emergency instructions on a large screen 
in the shape of an "X" pattern using a given instruction string. This unique design ensures visibility from 
different angles and grabs the attention of people in the area.
Your task is to write a program that takes an instruction string as input and generates an 
"X" pattern using characters from the string. The size of the pattern will be determined by the length of 
the string.
Input Format
A string s representing the emergency instruction message. Note: The length of the string n 
must be an odd integer greater than or equal to 3.
Constraints
NA
Output Format
An "X" pattern printed on a grid of size n x n, where n is the length of the string s.

Q5)
A microwave oven manufacturer recommends that when heating two items, add 50% to the heating time, 
and when heating three items double the heating time. Heating more than three items at once is not 
recommended. Write a program to find out the recommended heating time.
Input format:
The first input containing an integer which denotes the number of items
The second input containing the floating point number which denotes the single item heating time.
Output format:
Print the recommended heating time in floating point with 2 decimal places.
If the number of items is more than three, print "Number of items is more"
