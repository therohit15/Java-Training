// Q3)
// Car Speed
// You have an electric car whose speed is derived from the battery percentage
// The battery percentage is denoted by an integer value N and the speed is the sum of all the factors 
// of the battery percentage including 1. Your task is to find and return an integer value representing the speed of the car.
// Input Fomat
// Input1: An integer value N representing the battery percentage of the car.
// Output Fomat
// Return an integer value representing the speed of the car.
// Sample Input
// Input1:12
// Sample Output
// 28
// Explanation
// Here, the given battery percent is 12 and the factors of 12 are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, and 12. The sum of all the factors will be 
// 1+2+3+4+6+12=28. Therefore 28 is returned as the output
