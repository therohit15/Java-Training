// Q2
// Quality Check for Premium Products
// In a retail store, some products are considered "premium" if their product ID is a Prime Number. A Prime Number 
// is a number greater than 1 that has no divisors other than 1 and itself. Your task is to create a program that 
// checks whether the given product ID qualifies as "Premium" or not.
// Imagine a store manager who needs to filter out premium products for special promotions. If a product ID is a Prime Number, 
// it should be labeled as "Premium Product," otherwise, it should be labeled as "Regular Product."If the given product ID 
// is 1 consider it as "Regular Product".
// Input Format
// The first line of input contains an integer N, which represents the product ID.
// Output Format
// Print "Premium Product" if the product ID is a Prime Number.
// Print "Regular Product" if the product ID is not a Prime Number.
// Example 1
// Sample Input 1
// 17
// Sample Output 1
// Premium Product
// Explanation
// The number 17 is greater than 1 and has no divisors other than 1 and itself.
// Hence, the product ID 17 is a Prime Number, so the output is "Premium Product."
// Example 2
// Sample Input 2
// 20
// Sample Output 2
// Regular Product
// Explanation
// The number 20 is greater than 1 but has divisors other than 1 and itself (e.g., 2, 4, 5, 10).
// Hence, the product ID 20 is not a Prime Number, so the output is "Regular Product."
